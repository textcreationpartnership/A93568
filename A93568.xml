         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Therefore we mu≈øt begin to reckon from the fir≈øt artificiall haire in his Perriwig, to the la≈øt artificiall ≈øtitch in the ≈øoale of his Bootes: hold, hold, hold, what have we ≈øaid, we mu≈øt begin there, we mu≈øt give our

And our mi≈øtake would have been ≈øo gro≈ø≈øe, (if we had not ≈øpeedily collected and corrected our thoughts) as to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to have given the de≈øcription of the height of <hi>Pauls</hi> onely by relating the height of the Church, when wee ≈øhould de≈øcribe the height of <hi>Pauls</hi> by the Steeple: But having timely corrected our thoughts wee ≈øhall endeavour to begin at the height and top of this Roundheaded Gentlemans perfection: (Onely a little by the way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve it as one of his chiefe≈øt properties, that he loves and prides to be clothed with the newe≈øt fa≈øhion. And therefore he is full of invention, and his thoughts multiplicious and fruitfull, how he may have change of attire and fa≈øhion: yea rather then he will want any one fa≈øhion, he will ≈øo contrive by the advice of his grand and little and nimble coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the profe≈ø≈øors of the cro≈ø≈øelegd art, who are very dexterous in the compo≈øure of all fa≈øhions contracted and united in one, that this <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> being clothed in his new trappings, he is made the repre≈øentative body of all kindreds, tongues, and nations, his <hi>Roundhead</hi> confining his braines in ≈øuch a circle, that they run round about the Globed Center for every new ≈øtrange fa≈øhion.)</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt therefore for his hatt, it is fa≈øhioned like the blocke on which it was ≈øquared, being flat crowned, and not made fit to his head, but to his Perriwigg, and therefore it ≈øets to his Perriwigg as loo≈øe, as his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwigg to his bald pate, (unle≈ø≈øe it be tyed) ready to fall off to the right hand or to the left, to ≈øalute his brother <hi>Roundhead</hi> when he meets him: And wee know the rea≈øon of this fa≈øhion, becau≈øe the≈øe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants de≈øire and love to have their witts and heads at libertie, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to have their braines bound too fa≈øt, or confined in their noddles.</p>
               <p>Next, their hatt is narrow-brimd, &amp; they have a good rea≈øon for that, for whereas the ignorant ≈øort object again≈øt it, as unprofitable, yea pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall, for it expo≈øes their bodies to the weather, They give a ≈øudden an≈øwer to this Objection, and prove the contrary, That a good bu≈øh doth ≈øhelter them better from the weather, with which they are large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furni≈øhed.
